# Coin API
## Description
This project is the backbone for the mobile app project [Coin collector](https://github.com/Stroempell/coin-collector).  
It provides an API for the app to call the data about all 2 euro coins. Currently, only commemorative coins from 2004-2014 are included.
  
All countries can now be fetched with /api/countries.
